knn_algorithm
Basicly it simulates supervised learning ai operating on the knn algorithm, trying to find out and predict spec of the Iris.
IRIS.csv contains training data of the algorithm, and TEST.csv file is randomly generated data to test my program.
Insert your own specified data into the terminal or change/add your inputs into te user.csv file.
The main think of creating this program is to calculate currency-evaluation of the knn algorithm which depences on inserted data.
